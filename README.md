# Design_Patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. 
The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the
pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.
Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. 
While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level 
description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.
An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern 
is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.
